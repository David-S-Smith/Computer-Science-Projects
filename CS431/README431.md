From Spring 2018, junior year. Assignments focused on various algorithms designed to approach problems such as games, informed searches, and data classification. Also featured an implementation of a convolutional neural network built using the Keras API trained for data classification.

Final project was chosen by individual student, and in this case was a Rubik's cube solver built to find the shortest number of moves to solve a Rubik's cube through implementation of a Iterative Deepening A* (IDA*) algorithm.

Note: The Rubik's cube solver is named Rubick, which is a reference to a fictional character, not simply a misspelling. I promise I know how to spell the name of the toy I spent a good chunk of my junior semester obsessing over!
