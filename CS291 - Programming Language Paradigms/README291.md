These projects are from Sprint 2017, sophomore year. 

Programming Language Paradigms focused upon introducing students to programming languages that differed severely from Java, which most
classes up to that point focused on. The languages taught were Prolog, a near-pure logical programming language that attempts to greatly abstract
itself from the procedural structure programming eventually follows, and Haskell, a near-pure functional programming language.

In addition to small assignments, a larger assignment, solving a Bert Bos puzzle (linked in comments on documents) was assigned for both languages.
In the Prolog segment, this was a group project for teams of two. In the Haskell portion, it was an individual project.
